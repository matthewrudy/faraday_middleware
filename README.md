# Faraday Middlware

This is the old location of Faraday Middleware.  Only the release tags will be synced here.

Faraday Middleware now lives at https://github.com/lostisland/faraday_middleware

## Change Your Remote

Pick your poison (https, ssh, git).  Replace `origin` with the name you use to
refer to `pengwynn/faraday_middleware`.

    $ git remote set-url origin https://github.com/lostisland/faraday_middleware
    $ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:lostisland/faraday_middleware.git
    $ git remote set-url origin git://github.com/lostisland/faraday_middleware.git

## Host Your Own Faraday Repository

If you have a Faraday-related repository (middleware, adapters, etc), you are
more than welcome to host it under [lostisland][] if you like.  You'll get full
push and administrative access of course.
